Hi there!

I'm Aleksandr Maskalev.

I am an adept Python developer, initially embarking on small-scale projects for personal use, which eventually led me to assume a pivotal role in developing and maintaining a warehouse management system.

Throughout my journey, I have actively engaged in diverse projects, assuming various roles ranging from backend development to overseeing the seamless deployment of projects on servers.

I am committed to continuous professional development and am not confined to specific tools. I eagerly embrace modern industry practices and welcome opportunities to further my expertise as a developer.

Thank you for visiting my website! I hope you'll find something interesting here!
